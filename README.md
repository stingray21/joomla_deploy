### Script

Create a new plain text file and paste that [code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akeeba/vagrant/master/assets/joomla/install-joomla-extension.php) in it. 
Save it as install-joomla-extension.php in your Joomla! site's cli directory. 
(The name is not important, the location (cli directory) is.)

Now you can call it like this:

```
cd /path/to/site/cli php ./install-joomla-extension.php --package=/where/is/your/extension.zip
```

The script returns one of the following exit statuses:

    0. The extension was installed successfully.
    1. The package file was not found.
    3. The package file could not be extracted.
    250. The extension could not be installed.


â€‹	
You can copy this file to your site's cli directory and install extensions and extension updates any time you want.
